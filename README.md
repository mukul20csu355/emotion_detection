### Train Emotion detector
- You can train your model by running this file "TranEmotionDetector.py"

The model is trained for 50 epochs it took several minutes, it depends on your processor. (On i5 11400 H processor with 8 GB RAM and RTX 3050 it took me around 5 minutes) after Training the model, you will find the trained model structure and weights are stored in your project directory.

### run your emotion detection test file
python TestEmotionDetector.py
